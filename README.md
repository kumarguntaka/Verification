Welcome to the Verification repository! This repository serves as a hub for multiple verification projects in my profile, each organized as a submodule. The projects are primarily focused on digital, mixed signal and analog design verifications, using various simulation tools to develop and verify.

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new designs or improvements to existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
